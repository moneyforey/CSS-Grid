# CSS Grid 

When to use Grids and when to use flex?

CSS grid is used for creating templates in 2d array
while flex is used for creating one dimensional layouts.
flex is interpreted by the browser either row(default behaviour) or column.
flex is basis in content while grid is basis in layout.
that means we use grid for creating layout while flex is used for working on some content to arrange it on either on row side or on column side
